301a997e-224f-466a-90b9-f0f77a76de50-00-uoc32dyew2k5.worf.replit.dev/:1 Refused to execute inline event handler because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'none'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-...'), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution. Note that hashes do not apply to event handlers, style attributes and javascript: navigations unless the 'unsafe-hashes' keyword is present. Note also that 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
