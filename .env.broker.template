# NFT Broker Configuration Template
# Copy these lines to your .env file and fill in with real values

# ============================================
# BROKER WALLET CONFIGURATION (Required)
# ============================================

# RiddleNFTBroker (Security-First Implementation)
# This broker handles user-facing buy/sell offers with on-ledger validation
RIDDLE_BROKER_ADDRESS=rYourBrokerWalletAddress
RIDDLE_BROKER_SECRET=sYourBrokerWalletSeed

# NFTBrokerService (Simplified Implementation)  
# This broker handles admin operations and basic matching
# NOTE: Can use the SAME seed as RIDDLE_BROKER_SECRET above
BROKER_WALLET_SEED=sYourBrokerWalletSeed

# ============================================
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
# ============================================

# 1. Generate a NEW XRPL wallet OR use existing broker wallet:
#    - Use: https://xrpl.org/accounts.html (mainnet)
#    - Or use existing XRPL wallet with sufficient balance
#    - Save the address (starts with 'r') and secret (starts with 's')

# 2. Fund the broker wallet (MAINNET):
#    - Transfer at least 100 XRP to broker address
#    - Recommended: 200+ XRP for production operations
#    - Account must be activated on mainnet

# 3. Update the values above with your MAINNET credentials

# 4. Verify broker initialization:
#    - Restart server
#    - Check logs for "RiddleNFTBroker initialized"
#    - Check logs for "NFT Broker Service initialized"
#    - Both should show the same broker address
#    - Verify balance shows >100 XRP

# ============================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ============================================

# - NEVER commit .env file to git
# - Keep broker seed secret and secure
# - This is for MAINNET production deployment
# - Broker wallet needs 100+ XRP balance to operate
# - Broker collects fees automatically (1-1.589% per transaction)
# - Keep broker credentials secure - they control real funds

# ============================================
# MAINNET PRODUCTION
# ============================================

# Use your real mainnet broker wallet:
# RIDDLE_BROKER_ADDRESS=rYourMainnetBrokerAddress
# RIDDLE_BROKER_SECRET=sYourMainnetBrokerSeed
# BROKER_WALLET_SEED=sYourMainnetBrokerSeed

# IMPORTANT:
# - These are REAL mainnet credentials
# - Broker wallet will hold NFTs and collect fees
# - Minimum 100 XRP balance required
# - Recommended 200+ XRP for production
